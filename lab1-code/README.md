### Step-by-Step Instructions

### Install python 3.11.9
Install pyenv in home
```bash
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```
    
#### Add to shell init
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
```

Install python 3.11 locally
```bash
pyenv install 3.11.9
pyenv local 3.11.9
```

Make bash scripts executable
```bash
chmod +x ./scripts/*.sh && chmod +x ./*.sh
```

#### Bootstrap Environment (Run Once)

This script creates the necessary AWS resources that persist between deployments, such as the EC2 Key Pair and the main Security Group. It also creates a `.env` file to store the IDs of these resources.

```bash
./scripts/bootstrap_env.sh
```

#### Deploy the Entire Infrastructure

This is the script that provisions all instances, deploys the applications, configures the load balancer, and brings the entire system online.

```bash
./run.sh
```

Or step by step:

```bash
set -euo pipefail
```

Load environment variables
```bash
set -a; source .env; set +a
```

Setting up Python virtual environment and installing dependencies...
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip > /dev/null
pip install boto3 > /dev/null
pip install aiohttp > /dev/null
```

Provision application instances (4 micro, 4 large)
```bash
python scripts/provision_instances.py
```

Deploy FastAPI application to all instances
```bash
python scripts/deploy_fastapi.py
```

Provision the custom latency-based Load Balancer
```bash
python scripts/provision_lb.py
```

Deploy the Load Balancer application
```bash
python scripts/deploy_lb.py
```

Upon successful completion, the script will output the public IP address of the load balancer.

#### Test the System

You can manually verify that the system is working by sending requests to the cluster endpoints.

```bash
# Replace <LB_IP> with the IP address from the run.sh output
LB_IP="<LB_IP>"

# Test Cluster 1 (t2.large instances)
curl -s http://${LB_IP}/cluster1 ; echo

# Test Cluster 2 (t2.micro instances)
curl -s http://${LB_IP}/cluster2 ; echo

# Check the real-time status of the load balancer
curl -s http://${LB_IP}/status | jq
```

#### Run the Performance Benchmark

This script sends 1000 concurrent requests to each cluster and reports performance metrics like Requests Per Second (RPS) and average latency.

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install benchmark dependencies
pip install aiohttp

# Run the benchmark
python scripts/benchmark.py http://${LB_IP}
```

#### Cleanup

The `stop.sh` script will automatically find and terminate all EC2 instances created by this project and delete the associated security groups and local artifacts.

```bash
./stop.sh --confirm
```
